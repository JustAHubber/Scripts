# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I have created or edited. I am most likely not the original creator of code used, as there are only so many programs and so many ways things can be written; but, that is life, and we must move on. The point is, my brain was used for these projects and I enjoyed making them.

### Notices:
**Little warning:** *Some of these are malware but it is completely safe and obvious if you read **instructions** that come with all files.*

*Please do not use any of these projects maliciously, I created these with the intent of either **ethical**, or personal use on Virtual / Physical Machines, and Friends where **consent is given**.*

*If you run a file and it fails to run correctly, before assuming it is broken, run it using CMD or PS, and see if there are any missing imports as I usually use python. To fix a missing import you typically just have to do "pip install (Missing Module)". If that doesn't work, I normally google for 5 minutes, if it doesn't work, I re-install python, if that doesn't work, I move on with my life and forget about the immense time I just wasted. I do know of an unfortunate 3rd scenario which may require VS Build Tools, I can't remember what project it was for but it was annoying.*

# Projects:
Here is where the projects begin... how wonderful.
## Cryplography
Here is an example of Encrypting and Decrypting files with **Cryplography**

Now, here is proof that the file's data was maintained the same and nothing was damaged during encryption and decryption:
