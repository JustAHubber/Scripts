# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I have created or edited. I am most likely not the original creator of code used, as there are only so many programs and so many ways things can be written; but, that is life, and we must move on. The point is, my brain was used for these projects and I enjoyed making them.

**Who really knows what lurks in these directories...**

**Little warning:** *Some of these are malware but it is completely safe and obvious if you read **instructions** that come with all files.*

Please do not use any of these projects maliciously, I created these with the intent of either **ethical**, or personal use on Virtual / Physical Machines, and Friends where **consent is given**.

# Projects:

## Cryplography
Here is an example of Encrypting and Decrypting files with **Cryplography**

Now, here is proof that the file's data was maintained the same and nothing was damaged during encryption and decryption:
