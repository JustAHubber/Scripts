There are 3 port scanners which are all at different levels of programming.

The Simple port scanner is a simple localhost scanner that is slow and inefficient.
  This is purely just for fun.
  
The Quick port scanner is an advanced and upgraded version of the simple scanner that utilises the CPU more efficiently.
  This will only scan up to port 1024.

The Advanced port scanner will do the same as the Quick Port scanner but it will go into more detail and search through all 65535 ports.
  For the most common ports, there are descriptions for what they are.
