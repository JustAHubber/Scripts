The python RAT is a Reverse Sell Remote Access Tool.

It is a very simplistic execution:
  The Listening machine should run the Server.py (This can be executed on any operating system with python)
  The Victim machine should receive the RAT in its python form or use the example EXE I have created where the Icon and Name are trojan-horsified, if you will.
  Once this RAT is opened, It will establish a connection between the Victim and Listening machine with a shell where you can then execute any commands.
  
A very simple but effective script that can be used in numerous ways against victims.
