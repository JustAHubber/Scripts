This is a Pong Remote Access Trojan.

When ran, this file will appear to be an innocent game of pong but in reality, it will be connecting to a server script ran on the attacking machine, giving full access to the target with some pre-set commands.

Ping.py
  Server file (no configuration).
  The IP can be set to whatever you like. If you want to listen to public IPs, set the IP as 0.0.0.0.
  You may change the port to anything.
  
Pong.py
  Default RAT file (slight configuration).
  This RAT file will run on the victim machine without administrator, allowing basic command execution.
  The IP should be configured within the file before being built.
  The port can be changed to whatever as long as it is the same as the server.
  
Pong Admin.py
  Exact same RAT as the Pong.py, except, this one prompts the user for admin, in return, you can execute any command you like.
  Needs the same configuration where the IP should be configured.
  Port can also be changed to whatever as long as it is the same as the server.
  
 Building Batch Scripts
  Builds Pong files (requires no configuration)
  There are 2 batch scripts within this repository which will build both the Pong and Pong Admin Scripts depending on which you open.
  There are no dependencies, they are all included in the built files.
 
Requirements.bat
  Running this will utilise the requirements.txt file by installing all dependencies needed in the project.
  
There is also a Pong Icon in this repository so that you can build the projects with realistic icons and disguises.

Plans:
  I plan to separate the processes so that the RAT will run on a different, disguised process from the main thread therefore, making it much more robust.
  I also plan to make the RAT run on startup which will be configurable.
