Cryplography is an encryption program that aims to encrypt the data of files while completely maintaining integrity.

Your files can either be encrypted or decrypted in this lovely CLI

Syntax: file.py/file.exe [encrypt/decrypt] (file input) (file output)
  (Password)

Boom, files are now cryplogged.
I'm including the source code because this isn't pentagon-level security, unfortunately. 
A little secret between me and you... I am working on a remaster which makes it pentagon level.
